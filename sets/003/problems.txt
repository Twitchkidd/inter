4. Calculate the sum of numbers within an array

You can create your own array of numbers but consider trying this problem with
a few different sets to verify your solution. Have one array with negative and
positive numbers and another with integers and decimals.

You could also try using arrays of different lengths. If you're feeling
comfortable with this, try the slightly more challenging bonus challenge below.

Bonus intermediate challenge: Create a function that can return the sum of a
particular column or row number in a table.

5. Create a function that reverses an array

This challenge is particularly helpful if you're planning to become a Data
Scientist. Manipulating data is a significant part of the role, and building
the foundations now will help you later down the road when you're working with
large databases.

Start small here and work your way up. Begin with an array of 5 numbers, and
then try your program with a larger array to verify its success.

6. Sort an array from lowest to highest

You could create a function for this solution as well, but be sure to try your
program with varying lengths and types of arrays. Try one with all integers,
another with negative numbers, and another with decimals.
