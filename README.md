# Interview Time!

## Oh No

## Finishing Problems

### repeatedWord

Eugh, sort is `a,b => a - /\* MINUS \*/ b not a,b => a < /\* LESS THAN \*/ b`. I didn't need to make the code that small, either. Nice, but took too long (like 40 minutes,) you can go faster.

### secondNum

Okay, 15 minutes is better, still need to go faster. Use new Set(array) and \[...set\] to get back to an array.

### triangle

Okay, that took a while again, and I resorted to imperative programming. Maybe 30 minutes? Good sesh though.

## Second Problem Set

To the future! [More coding problems!](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/10-javascript-code-challenges-for-beginners/)

### Print even numbers in a range

Ready set go! -- Okay, 12 minutes! And a minute faffing about! Lol next, go!

### Print a multiplication table

1:11, go! -- Okay, 22 minutes, somehow? And I really want to calculate the maximum width with a reverse sort and switch the answers to strings and come up with some rules for spaces, but it didn't ask for that, maybe next time.

### Kilometers to miles

1:33 to ... 1:56! Okay, well, those three did take me just about an hour! Next time faster, next time more, and I think debriefing the previous set might be the very next thing!

## Third Problem Set

Here we go! Except before we start, we're going to get these and then where's the timer? Okay, pomr, thirty minutes in total,
shoot for ten minutes for each? 10:54, go! Switch over at 11:04 and 11:14, and be done by 11:24!!!

### Sum of numbers in an array

Please don't take ten minutes for this! Lord, you took longer, lol, it's 11:10, 14 minutes!

### The next two

Okay, those weren't really compelling challenges, it's 11:18, let's make a snippet for answering these sort of questions!

## Fourth Problem Set

Let's try for four in a half an hour! Go! 12:48, now 12:50, lol. -- Checking in, going to learn some regex, we're at 1:00, reminder the finish time is 1:18!

-- Mmm, 1:20! `pomr` needs to be able to get my attention somehow!

## Fifth Problem Set!

Today should be good! 10:15, 10:25, 10:35!

-- Uhh, okay, 10:46, but solid work!

## Sixth Problem Set

Oh no! I'm beyond tired! Interesting stuff with regexes though, and why handling multiline text that could come from either operating system is hard, and maybe a little beyond the scope of something I could finish in 10 minutes, so I'm like actually tired though, so we're going to have to tackle the problem of handling cross-platform tabs and newlines and putting them back again at the end of the day when we wake up early tomorrow, is the theory. Ow, my back, lol.
