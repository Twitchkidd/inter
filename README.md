### repeatedWord

Eugh, sort is `a,b => a - /\* MINUS \*/ b not a,b => a < /\* LESS THAN \*/ b`. I didn't need to make the code that small, either. Nice, but took too long (like 40 minutes,) you can go faster.

### secondNum

Okay, 15 minutes is better, still need to go faster. Use new Set(array) and \[...set\] to get back to an array.

### triangle

Okay, that took a while again, and I resorted to imperative programming. Maybe 30 minutes? Good sesh though.
