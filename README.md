# Interview Time!

## Oh No

## Finishing Problems

### repeatedWord

Eugh, sort is `a,b => a - /\* MINUS \*/ b not a,b => a < /\* LESS THAN \*/ b`. I didn't need to make the code that small, either. Nice, but took too long (like 40 minutes,) you can go faster.

### secondNum

Okay, 15 minutes is better, still need to go faster. Use new Set(array) and \[...set\] to get back to an array.

### triangle

Okay, that took a while again, and I resorted to imperative programming. Maybe 30 minutes? Good sesh though.

## Second Problem Set

To the future!

### Print even numbers in a range

Ready set go! -- Okay, 12 minutes! And a minute faffing about! Lol next, go!

### Print a multiplication table

1:11, go! -- Okay, 22 minutes, somehow? And I really want to calculate the maximum width with a reverse sort and switch the answers to strings and come up with some rules for spaces, but it didn't ask for that, maybe next time.

### Kilometers to miles

1:33 to ... 1:56! Okay, well, those three did take me just about an hour! Next time faster, next time more, and I think debriefing the previous set might be the very next thing!

## Third Problem Set

Here we go!
